### Config inside MakeHappyTeam project
* In source code

*A copy of CakePHPâ€™s database configuration file is found in MakeHappyTeam/app/Config/database.php.default. Make a copy of this file in the same directory, but name it database.php.*
*Replace the values in the $default array with those that apply to your setup. Configuration array might look something like the following:*
```
public $default = array(
		'datasource' => 'Database/Mysql',
		'persistent' => false,
		'host' => 'mht-db',
		'login' => 'root',
		'password' => '',
		'database' => 'make_happy',
		'prefix' => '',
	);
```
* In container mht-db: Access to mysql with 'user' => 'root' and 'password' => ' '. Then create database name "make_happy"

In ~/Project/MHT/MakeHappyTeam run this command line to import database structure: 
```
docker exec -i mht-db mysql -u root make_happy < DDL/DDL_Struct_Make_Happy.sql 
```
If you want to insert example data, run file from this path:
``` 
docker exec -i mht-db mysql -u root make_happy < DDL/DDL_Insert_Make_Happy.sql
```

## Testing

### Test Database Setup

*Before running any tests you should be sure to add a $test database configuration. This configuration is used by CakePHP for fixture tables and data:*

```
public $test = array(
    'datasource' => 'Database/Mysql',
    'persistent' => false,
    'host' => 'mht-db',
    'login' => 'root',
    'password' => '',
    'database' => 'test',
    'prefix' => '',
);
```
